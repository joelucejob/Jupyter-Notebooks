# Machine Learning Employee Attrition Challenge

#### September 2017

Ignore versions 1 to 3, use them as an example of what NOT to do. Version 4 is a lot better approach to best practices.

Goal is to figure whether of not an employee would leave or stay in the company. The 'Attrition' column is that representation.

You are given a training file with an 'Attrition' column and other columns and another file containing a testing set to fill out the 'Attrition' column to submit.
Required to submit a csv file with two columns, an Attrition column and the EmployeeId column.
