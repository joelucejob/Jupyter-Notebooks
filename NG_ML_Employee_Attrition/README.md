# Northrop Grumman Machine Learning Employee Attrition Challenge

#### September 2017

Goal is to figure whether of not an employee would leave or stay in the company. 
The dataset is just some random dataset and does not represent Northrop in anyway.

You are given a training file with an 'Attrition' column and other columns and another file containing a testing set to fill out the 'Attrition' column to submit.
Required to submit a csv file with two columns, an Attrition column and the EmployeeId column.
